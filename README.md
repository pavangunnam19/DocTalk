DocTalk
Overview
DocTalk is an innovative application designed to enable seamless interaction with PDF documents through a conversational interface. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it combines advanced document processing with natural language understanding to provide accurate, context-aware responses. Built with Python, LangChain, and vector stores like FAISS or Chroma, DocTalk employs text embeddings and chunking techniques to efficiently retrieve and generate insights from complex documents. The user-friendly Streamlit interface makes it accessible for exploring legal documents, research papers, invoices, and more. Ideal for professionals and researchers seeking to extract knowledge from PDFs effortlessly.
Features

Conversational Retrieval: Chat with your PDFs to ask questions and get precise answers.
RAG Integration: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced response accuracy.
Document Loading: Supports various document loaders for flexible input handling.
Vector Storage: Utilizes FAISS or Chroma for efficient text embeddings and retrieval.
Streamlit UI: Provides an intuitive, interactive interface for users.
